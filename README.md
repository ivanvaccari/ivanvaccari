### Hi!
I'm Ivan, a software developer from [Mantova (IT)](https://www.google.it/maps/place/46100+Mantova+MN/@45.1618212,10.7526511,14z).

I mostly work on the backend-side of cloud-based software solutions, integration and linux-server management, but sometimes i aslo get in touch with a lot of different technologies related to IoT and industry.

On free time i jump on my bike and ride around the countryside, or hike in the mountains. I also try to build small IoT electronic projects, using [EasyEda](https://easyeda.com/it), [jlcPcb](https://jlcpcb.com/) and [Esp mcu's](https://www.espressif.com/).

### Some of my cs-related rules
- Computer is ALWAYS right. Either your software is broken, or your environment is broken.
- Don't overcomplicate code for simple task, it will bite back somewhere in future. Basically, [follow KISS rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). 
- Do not expect to extract gold from bad data (this is especially dedicated to customers!)
- Bad solutions are better than no solutions.
- If docs say "You can't do this!" then "You can't do this!", if docs don't say anything about it then "You probably can do it, give it a try!"
- Temporary solutions are much less temporary than you think.
- Automatic stuff is great, but it might automatically stop working somewhere in time. If you rely on it for your project, at least dedicate some times to learn how yo do it manually.
- Best practices from one language does not automatically transfer to other languages
- Algorithmic is hard to learn and  make up 90% of a developer skills. Specific language syntax, semantics and features are easy to learn and make up 10% of a developer skills.
- Right tools make your job 50% easier.
- Super-duper, ultra popular frameworks, make your job easier 95% of the times. The remaining 5% of the times they just push you to madness.
- Most of the stuff we develop today was doable also 30 years ago, it just become easier to do it.
- Do not let dates beat you. Choose one only format and stick to it, no matter what. Any other format sholud be rejected or converted to your format. Don't even think of managing some special cases by hand

### Secrets in software companies
- If a developer says your request is not addressable, you can be sure the reason is one of the following: you are not paying him enough, he don't know how to do it, you request is ABSOLUTELY, PURE, THE BIGGEST EVER garbage.
